# My-Portfolio-Project
This is a simple basic project I did using my knowledge of HTML5, basic CSS and CSS bootstrap. 
Through this project I was able to navigate different aspects necessary for a simple website
as well as colour theory and how to make a website appealing. Using bootstrap I was also able to focus on
the website's responsiveness as well.
